			<h2 is-upgraded>Thick Client</h2>
      <ul>
      <li>A thick / heavy / rich or fat client) is a computer, in client–server architecture or networks, that typically provides rich functionality independent of the central server.</li>
      </ul>
      <h2 is-upgraded>Advantages</h2>
			<ul>
			<li>Lower server requirements</li>
			<li>Working offline</li>
			<li>Better multimedia performance</li>
			<li>More flexibility</li>
      <li>Using existing infrastructure</li>
      <li>Higher server capacity</li>
			</ul>
			<h2 is-upgraded>Introduction</h2>
			<ul>
			<li>Thick client applications have been around for many years and can still be found within a variety of organizations – across industries and sizes. Due to the adoption of hybrid infrastructure architecture, thick-client applications can become a better target for attackers.</li>
			<li>Thick client pentesting involves both local and server-side processing and often uses proprietary protocols for communication.</li>
			<li>Simple automated assessment scanning is not sufficient and testing thick client applications requires a lot of patience and a methodical approach. Moreover, the process often requires specialized tools and custom testing setup.</li>
			<li>Thick client testing can be exciting for pentesters because the attack surface of these applications can be significant.</li>
      </ul>
      <aside class="special"><strong>Note:</strong> Unlike web applications or infrastructure pentests, thick client pentests have a more notable success rate because the client is available locally and, hence, critical vulnerabilities may be found during the engagements.</aside>
      <ul>
			<li>Thick client applications can be developed using various programming languages such as:</li>
        <li>.Net</li>
        <li>Java</li>
        <li>C/C++</li>
        <li>Microsoft Silverlight</li>
      </ul>

      <google-codelab-step label="Architecture" duration="20">
        There are two types of architectures
        <p><b>Two-Tier architecture</b></p>
        <p>In two-tier architecture, the thick client application implements a client-to-server communication. The application is installed on the client computer and, in order to work, will need to communicate with a database server. For example, imagine an HR application that was installed on the client computer and, in order to retrieve the employees’ information, communicates directly with the HR database server.</p>
        <p class="image-container"><img src="../tc/tc1.jpg" alt="Two Tier Architecture"></p>
        <p><b>Three-Tier architecture</b></p>
        <p>In three-tier architecture, the client communicates with an application server, which in turn talks to the database in a manner similar to a regular web application. The most common communication method in these applications may be carried out using HTTP/HTTPS.</p>
        <p>Three-tier architecture has a security advantage over two-tier architecture, because it prevents the end-user from communicating directly with the database server.</p>
