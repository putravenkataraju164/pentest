			<h2 is-upgraded>Android</h2>
			<p>Android is a mobile operating system based on a modified version of the Linux kernel and other open source software, designed primarily for touchscreen mobile devices such as smartphones and tablets. Android is developed by a consortium of developers known as the Open Handset Alliance, with the main contributor and commercial marketer being Google.</p>
			<h2 is-upgraded>Android Application Penetration Testing</h2>
			<p>It is the process of testing and finding security issues in an android applications. Android security testing is more often used by security researchers to test the vulnerabilities in Android applications.</p>
			<h2 is-upgraded>What you&#39;ll learn</h2>
			<ul>
			<li>How to retrive an APK file</li>
			<li>How to decompile and reverse engineer the APK</li>
			<li>How to build and sign the APK</li>
			<li>How to find security vulnerabilities in the APK</li>
			</ul>

	  <ul>
	  <li><b>Applications:</b> Android Applications comprise both the native applications provided with the particular Android implementation (for example web browser and email applications) and the third-party applications installed by the user after purchasing the device. Typical applications include Camera, Alarm, Clock, Calculator, Contacts, Calendar, Media Player, and so forth.</li>
	  <li><b>Application Framework:</b> The Application Framework layer provides many higher-level services to applications in the form of Java classes. Application developers are allowed to make use of these services in their applications.</li> 
	  <li><b>Libraries:</b> The libraries shown in the image are very necessary without which application will not run like Webkit library is used for browsing the web , SQLite library is used for maintaining SQL database and so on.</li> 
	  <aside class="special"><h2 is-upgraded>Some useful libraries:</h2>
	  <ul>
	  <li><u>Surface Manager:</u> This manages the windows and screens </li>
	  <li><u>Media Framework:</u> This allows the use of various types of codecs for playback and recording of different media</li>
	  <li><u>SQLite:</u> This is a lighter version of SQL used for database management</li>
      <li><u>WebKit:</u> This is the browser rendering engine</li>
	  <li><u>OpenGL:</u> This is used to render 2D and 3D contents on the screen properly the libraries in Android are written in C and C++</li>
	  </ul>
	  </aside>
	  <li><b>Dalvik Virtual Machine: </b> DVM is specifically designed by Android Open Source Project to execute application written for Android.Each app running in the Android Device has its own Dalvik Virtual Machine</li>
	  <li><b>Android Run Time: </b> It is a alternative to Dalvik Virtual Machine which has been released with Android 4.4 as an experimental release,in Android Lollipop(5.0) it will completely replace Dalvik Virtual Machine.Major change in ART is because of Ahead-of-time(AOT) Compilation and Garbage Collection. In Ahead-of-time(AOT) Compilation ,android apps will be compiled when user installs them on their device whereas in the Dalvik used Just-in-time(JIT) compilation in which bytecode are compiled when user runs the app. Moving to the last one ,these are common.</li>
	  <li><b>Hardware Abstraction Layer:</b> Hardware Abstraction Layer just gives Applications direct access to the Hardware resources</li>
	  <li><b>Linux Kernel:</b> Android is built up on the Linux Kernel. Linux is already being used extensively from so many years and it’s kernel had received so many security patches. Linux Kernel provides basic system functionality like process management, memory management, device management like camera, keypad, display etc. Also, the kernel handles all the things that Linux is really good at such as networking and a vast array of device drivers, which take the pain out of interfacing to peripheral hardware.</li>

	   <h2 is-upgraded>Android Apps</h2>
	   <p>Android apps are written in the Java programming language. The Android SDK tools compile your code—along with any data and resource files—into an APK: an Android package, which is an archive file with an .apk suffix. One APK file contains all the contents of an Android app and is the file that Android-powered devices use to install the app</p>
	   <p class="image-container"><img src="../aapt/and_apps.png" alt="android apps"></p>
	   <p><b>An APK file is an Archive (ZIP File) that usually contains the following directories:</b></p>
	   <p><pre><code><b>AndroidManifest.xml</b> is very important part of an APK file especially when security is concerned. </code></pre></p>
	   <aside class="special">
		<p><b><u>AndroidManifest.xml:</u></b> The AndroidManifest.xml file is the control file that tells the system what to do with all the top-level components (specifically activities, services, broadcast receivers, and content providers) in an application.<br> This also specifies which permissions are required.</p>
		<p><b><u>META-INF directory:</u></b></p>
		<ul>
	    <li><b><u>MANIFEST.MF:</u></b> The Manifest File</li>
		<li><b><u>CERT.RSA:</u></b> The certificate of the application.</li>
		<li><b><u>CERT.SF:</u></b> The list of resources and SHA-1 digest of the corresponding lines in the MANIFEST.MF file.</li>
		</ul>
		<p><b><u>lib:</u></b> The directory containing the compiled code that is specific to a software layer of a processor, the directory is split into more directories within it:</p>
		<ul>
		<li><b><u>armeabi:</u></b> Compiled code for all ARM based processors only</li>
		<li><b><u>armeabi-v7a:</u></b> Compiled code for all ARMv7 and above based processors only</li>
		<li><b><u>x86:</u></b> Compiled code for X86</li>
		<li><b><u>mips:</u></b> Compiled code for MIPS processors only</li>
		</ul>
		<p><b><u>res:</u></b> The directory containing resources not compiled into resources.arsc (see below).</b></p>
		<p><b><u>assets:</u></b> A directory containing applications assets, which can be retrieved by AssetManager.</b></p>
		<p><b><u>classes.dex:</u></b> The classes compiled in the dex file format understandable by the Dalvik virtual machine</b></p>
		<p><b><u>resources.arsc:</u></b> A file containing precompiled resources, such as binary XML for example.</b></p>

	   <h2 is-upgraded>Application Security Features by Android</h2>
	   <p><b>Android Permission Model</b></p>
	   <p>By default there are some Protected API’s in the Android Opertating System which can only be accessed by Operating System. The Protected APIs include</p>
		<ul>
		<li>Camera functions</li>
		<li>Location data (GPS)</li>
		<li>Bluetooth functions</li>
		<li>Telephony functions</li>
		<li>SMS/MMS functions</li>
		<li>Network/data connections</li>
		</ul>
		<aside class="special">If a particular application needs access to any of the API then it need to mention that permission in AndroidManifest.xml file. You might have observed that when installing a particular application from Google Play Store it ask for several permissions needed,if you don’t allow then app won’t install. If that user agrees to grant those permissions then Android operating system gives access to that Protected API.</aside>
	    <p><b>Application Signing</b></p>
		<ul>
		<li>Android requires that all apps be digitally signed with a certificate before they can be installed. Android uses this certificate to identify the author of an app.</li>
		<li>To run application on the device ,it should be signed.When application is installed on to an device then package manager verifies that whether the application has been properly signed with the certificate in the apk file or not.</li>
		<li>Application can be self signed or can be signed through CA.</li>
		<li>Application signing ensures that one application can’t access any other application except through well-defined IPC and also that it is passed unmodified to the device.</li>
		</ul>
		<p><b>Application Verification</b></p>
		<ul>
		<li>Android 4.2 and later support application verification. Users can choose to enable “Verify Apps” and have applications evaluated by an application verifier prior to installation.</li>
		<li>App verification can alert the user if they try to install an app that might be harmful; if an application is especially bad, it can block installation.</li>
		</ul>
		<p><b>Android Sandbox</b></p>
		<p>Once installed on a device, each Android app lives in its own security sandbox: – The Android operating system is a multi-user Linux system in which each app is a different user.</p>
		<ul>
		<li>By default, The android system assigns each app a unique Linux user ID (the ID is used only by the system and is unknown to the app). The system sets permissions for all the files in an app so that only the user ID assigned to that app can access them.</li>
		<li>Each process has its own virtual machine (VM), so an app’s code runs in isolation from other apps.</li>
        <li>Every app runs in its own Linux process. Android starts the process when any of the app’s components need to be executed, then shuts down the process when it’s no longer needed or when the system must recover memory for other apps.</li>
