			<h2 is-upgraded>Android</h2>
			<p>Android is a mobile operating system based on a modified version of the Linux kernel and other open source software, designed primarily for touchscreen mobile devices such as smartphones and tablets. Android is developed by a consortium of developers known as the Open Handset Alliance, with the main contributor and commercial marketer being Google.</p>
			<h2 is-upgraded>Android Application Penetration Testing</h2>
			<p>It is the process of testing and finding security issues in an android applications. Android security testing is more often used by security researchers to test the vulnerabilities in Android applications.</p>
			<h2 is-upgraded>What you&#39;ll learn</h2>
			<ul>
			<li>How to retrive an APK file</li>
			<li>How to decompile and reverse engineer the APK</li>
			<li>How to build and sign the APK</li>
			<li>How to find security vulnerabilities in the APK</li>
			</ul>

	  <h2 is-upgraded>Android Architecture</h2>
	  <p class="image-container"><img src="../aapt/and_arch.jpg" alt="android architecture"></p>
	  <ul>
	  <li><b>Applications:</b> Android Applications comprise both the native applications provided with the particular Android implementation (for example web browser and email applications) and the third-party applications installed by the user after purchasing the device. Typical applications include Camera, Alarm, Clock, Calculator, Contacts, Calendar, Media Player, and so forth.</li>
	  <li><b>Application Framework:</b> The Application Framework layer provides many higher-level services to applications in the form of Java classes. Application developers are allowed to make use of these services in their applications.</li> 
	  <li><b>Libraries:</b> The libraries shown in the image are very necessary without which application will not run like Webkit library is used for browsing the web , SQLite library is used for maintaining SQL database and so on.</li> 
	  <aside class="special"><h2 is-upgraded>Some useful libraries:</h2>
	  <ul>
	  <li>Surface Manager: This manages the windows and screens </li>
	  <li>Media Framework: This allows the use of various types of codecs for playback and recording of different media</li>
	  <li>SQLite: This is a lighter version of SQL used for database management</li>
      <li>WebKit: This is the browser rendering engine</li>
	  <li>OpenGL: This is used to render 2D and 3D contents on the screen properly the libraries in Android are written in C and C++</li>
	  </ul>
	  </aside>
	  <li><b>Hardware Abstraction Layer:</b> Hardware Abstraction Layer just gives Applications direct access to the Hardware resources</li>
	  <li><b>Linux Kernel:</b> Android is built up on the Linux Kernel. Linux is already being used extensively from so many years and itâ€™s kernel had received so many security patches. Linux Kernel provides basic system functionality like process management, memory management, device management like camera, keypad, display etc. Also, the kernel handles all the things that Linux is really good at such as networking and a vast array of device drivers, which take the pain out of interfacing to peripheral hardware.</li>
