	  <h2 is-upgraded>The Web</h2>
	  <ul>
	  <li>Web applications are probably the most common services exposed by companies and institutions on the internet; furthermore, most old applications have now a "web version" to be available in the browser. This massive transformation makes web security an important part of a network's security.</li>
	  </ul>
	  <h2 is-upgraded>Web security risks</h2>
	  <ul>
	  <li>Compromise.</li>
	  <li>Information leak.</li>
	  <li>Reputational damage.</li>
      <li>Information loss.</li>
	  <li>Money loss.</li>
	  </ul>
	  <h2 is-upgraded>Web Architecture</h2>
	  <p><b>Architecture:</b> Most web applications rely on 3 components:</p>
	  <ul>
	  	<li>The client: a web browser in most cases.</li>
	  	<li>The web server that will receive requests from the client. An application server can be involved to process the requests; in that case the web server will just forward the requests to the application server.</li>
	  	<li>The storage backend to retrieve and save information, most commonly a database.</li>
	  </ul>
	  <aside class="special">
	  All these components may have different behaviours that will impact the existence and exploitability of vulnerability. All these components can also present vulnerabilities or security issues.
		</aside>
		<h2 is-upgraded>Client side technologies</h2>
		<p>Most of the client side technologies are used every day by most Internet users: HTML, JavaScript, Flash... through their browsers (Chromium, Firefox, Internet Explorer, Safari...). However, web applications' clients can also be a thick client connecting to a web service or just a script.</p>
		<h2 is-upgraded>Server side technologies</h2>
		<p>On the server side a lot of technologies can be used and even if all may be vulnerable to any web issue, some issues are more likely to happen for a given technology.</p>
		<ul>The server side can be divided into more sub-categories:
			<li>Web servers like Apache, lighttpd, Nginx, IIS...</li>
			<li>Application servers like Tomcat, Jboss, Oracle Application server...</li>
			<li>The programming language used: PHP, Java, Ruby, Python, ASP, C#, ... This programming language can also be used as part of a framework like Ruby-on-Rails, .Net MVC, Django.</li>
		</ul>
		<h2 is-upgraded>Storage backend</h2>
		<p>The storage backend can be located on the same server as the web server or on a different one. This can explain weird behaviour during the exploitation of some vulnerabilities.</p>
		<p>A few examples of backends are:</p>
		<ul>
			<li>Simple files.</li>
			<li>Relational databases like Mysql, Oracle, SQL Server, PostgreSQL.</li>
		    <li>Other databases like MongoDB, CouchDB.</li>
			<li>Directories like openLDAP or Active Directory.</li>
		</ul>
		<aside class="special">An application can use more than one storage backend. For example, some applications use LDAP to store users and their credentials and use Oracle to store information.</aside>

	  	  <h2 is-upgraded>What is WWW?</h2>
		<p>WWW stands for World Wide Web. A technical definition of the World Wide Web is − All the resources and users on the Internet that are using the Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP).</p>
		<p>A broader definition comes from the organization that Web inventor Tim Berners-Lee helped found, the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C): The World Wide Web is the universe of network-accessible information, an embodiment of human knowledge.</p>
		<p>In simple terms, The World Wide Web is a way of exchanging information between computers on the Internet, tying them together into a vast collection of interactive multimedia resources.</p>
		<h2 is-upgraded> What is HTTP?</h2>
		<p>HTTP stands for Hypertext Transfer Protocol. This is the protocol being used to transfer hypertext documents that makes the World Wide Web possible.</p>
		<p>A standard web address such as Yahoo.com is called a URL and here the prefix http indicates its protocol</p>
		<h2 is-upgraded>What is URL?</h2>
		<p>URL stands for Uniform Resource Locator, and is used to specify addresses on the World Wide Web. A URL is the fundamental network identification for any resource connected to the web (e.g., hypertext pages, images, and sound files).</p>
		<p>A URL will have the following format −</p>
		<p><pre><code>protocol://hostname/other_information</code></pre></p>
		<p>The protocol specifies how information is transferred from a link. The protocol used for web resources is HyperText Transfer Protocol (HTTP). Other protocols compatible with most web browsers include FTP, telnet, newsgroups, and Gopher.</p>
		<p>The protocol is followed by a colon, two slashes, and then the domain name. The domain name is the computer on which the resource is located.</p>
		<p>Links to particular files or subdirectories may be further specified after the domain name. The directory names are separated by single forward slashes.</p>

	   <google-codelab-step label="HTTP Protocol" duration="10">
	    <p><b>Hypertext Transfer Protocol</b></p>
	    <ul>
	    	<li>Hypertext transfer protocol (HTTP) is the core communications protocol used to access the World Wide Web and is used by all of today’s web applications. It is a simple protocol that was originally developed for retrieving static text-based resources. It has since been extended and leveraged in various ways to enable it to support the complex distributed applications that are now commonplace</li>
	    	<li>HTTP uses a message-based model in which a client sends a request mes-sage and the server returns a response message. The protocol is essentially connectionless: although HTTP uses the stateful TCP protocol as its transport mechanism, each exchange of request and response is an autonomous transac-tion and may use a different TCP connection.</li>
	    </ul>
	   <p><b> What is HTTPS?</b></p>
		<p>HTTPS (Hypertext Transfer Protocol Secure) is an internet communication protocol that protects the integrity and confidentiality of data between the user's computer and the site. Users expect a secure and private online experience when using a website. We encourage you to adopt HTTPS in order to protect your users' connections to your website, regardless of the content on the site.</p>
		<p>Data sent using HTTPS is secured via Transport Layer Security protocol (TLS), which provides three key layers of protection:</p>
		<ol>
			<li>Encryption—encrypting the exchanged data to keep it secure from eavesdroppers. That means that while the user is browsing a website, nobody can "listen" to their conversations, track their activities across multiple pages, or steal their information.</li>
			<li>Data integrity—data cannot be modified or corrupted during transfer, intentionally or otherwise, without being detected.</li>
			<li>Authentication—proves that your users communicate with the intended website. It protects against man-in-the-middle attacks and builds user trust, which translates into other business benefits.</li>
		</ol>

	    <p><b>HTTP Requests</b></p>
	    <p>All HTTP messages (requests and responses) consist of one or more headers, each on a separate line, followed by a mandatory blank line, followed by an optional message body. A typical HTTP request is as follows:</p>
	    <p><pre><code>
GET /auth/488/YourDetails.ashx?uid=129 HTTP/1.1
Accept: application/x-ms-application, image/jpeg, application/xaml+xml,
image/gif, image/pjpeg, application/x-ms-xbap, application/x-shockwaveflash, */*
Referer: https://mdsec.net/auth/488/Home.ashx
Accept-Language: en-GB
User-Agent: Mozilla/4.0 (compatible; MSIE 8.0; Windows NT 6.1; WOW64;
Trident/4.0; SLCC2; .NET CLR 2.0.50727; .NET CLR 3.5.30729; .NET CLR
3.0.30729; .NET4.0C; InfoPath.3; .NET4.0E; FDM; .NET CLR 1.1.4322)
Accept-Encoding: gzip, deflate
Host: mdsec.net
Connection: Keep-Alive
Cookie: SessionId=5B70C71F3FD4968935CDB6682E545476<</code></pre></p>
	    <p>The first line of every HTTP request consists of three items, separated by spaces:</p>
		<ul>
	    <li>A verb indicating the HTTP method. The most commonly used method isGET, whose function is to retrieve a resource from the web server. GETrequests do not have a message body, so no further data follows the blank line after the message headers</li>
	    <li>The requested URL. The URL typically functions as a name for the resource being requested, together with an optional query string containing param-eters that the client is passing to that resource. The query string is indicated by the ? character in the URL. The example contains a single parameter with the name uid and the value 129.</li>
	    <li>The HTTP version being used. The only HTTP versions in common use on the Internet are 1.0 and 1.1, and most browsers use version 1.1 by default. There are a few differences between the specifi cations of these two versions; however, the only difference you are likely to encounter when attacking web applications is that in version 1.1 the Host request header is mandatory.</li>
	    </ul>
	    <ul>Here are some other points of interest in the sample request:
	    <li>TheReferer header is used to indicate the URL from which the request originated (for example, because the user clicked a link on that page). Note that this header was misspelled in the original HTTP specifi cation, and the misspelled version has been retained ever since</li>
	    <li>TheUser-Agent header is used to provide information about the browser or other client software that generated the request. Note that most brows-ers include the Mozilla prefi x for historical reasons. This was the User-Agent string used by the originally dominant Netscape browser, and other browsers wanted to assert to websites that they were compatible with this standard. As with many quirks from computing history, it has become so established that it is still retained, even on the current version of Internet Explorer, which made the request shown in the example</li>
	    <li>The Host header specifi es the hostname that appeared in the full URL being accessed. This is necessary when multiple websites are hosted on the same server, because the URL sent in the fi  rst line of the request usu-ally does not contain a hostname. (See Chapter 17 for more information about virtually hosted websites.)</li>
	    <li>The Cookie header is used to submit additional parameters that the server has issued to the client</li>
		</ul>
		<p><b>HTTP Response</b></p>
		<p>A typical HTTP response is as follows:</p>
		<p><pre><code>
HTTP/1.1 200 OK
Date: Tue, 19 Apr 2011 09:23:32 GMT
Server: Microsoft-IIS/6.0
X-Powered-By: ASP.NET
Set-Cookie: tracking=tI8rk7joMx44S2Uu85nSWc
X-AspNet-Version: 2.0.50727
Cache-Control: no-cache
Pragma: no-cache
Expires: Thu, 01 Jan 1970 00:00:00 GMT
Content-Type: text/html; charset=utf-8
Content-Length: 1067</code></pre></p>
		<p>The first line of every HTTP response consists of three items, separated by spaces:</p>
		<ul>
		<li>The HTTP version being used.</li>
		<li>A numeric status code indicating the result of the request. 200 is the most common status code; it means that the request was successful and that the requested resource is being returned.</li>
		<li>A textual “reason phrase” further describing the status of the response. This can have any value and is not used for any purpose by current browsers.</li>
		</ul>
		<p>Here are some other points of interest in the response:</p>
		<ul>
		<li>The Server header contains a banner indicating the web server software being used, and sometimes other details such as installed modules and the server operating system. The information contained may or may not be accurate.</li>
		<li>The Set-Cookie header issues the browser a further cookie; this is submitted back in the Cookie header of subsequent requests to this server.</li>
		<li>The Pragma header instructs the browser not to store the response in its cache. The Expires header indicates that the response content expire in the past and therefore should not be cached. These instructions are frequently issued when dynamic content is being returned to ensure that browsers obtain a fresh version of this content on subsequent occasions.</li>
		<li>Almost all HTTP responses contain a message body following the blank line after the headers. The Content-Type header indicates that the body of this message contains an HTML document.</li>
		<li>The Content-Length header indicates the length of the message body in bytes.</li>
		</ul>
		<p><b>HTTP Methods</b></p>
		<p>HTTP defines a set of request methods to indicate the desired action to be performed for a given resource. Although they can also be nouns, these request methods are sometimes referred to as HTTP verbs. Each of them implements a different semantic, but some common features are shared by a group of them: e.g. a request method can be safe, idempotent, or cacheable.</p>
		<ul>
			<li><b>GET:</b> The GET method requests a representation of the specified resource. Requests using GET should only retrieve data.</li>
			<li><b>HEAD:</b> The HEAD method asks for a response identical to that of a GET request, but without the response body.</li>
			<li><b>POST:</b> The POST method is used to submit an entity to the specified resource, often causing a change in state or side effects on the server.</li>
			<li><b>PUT:</b> The PUT method replaces all current representations of the target resource with the request payload.</li>
			<li><b>DELETE:</b> The DELETE method deletes the specified resource.</li>
			<li><b>CONNECT:</b> The CONNECT method establishes a tunnel to the server identified by the target resource.</li>
			<li><b>OPTIONS:</b> The OPTIONS method is used to describe the communication options for the target resource.</li>
			<li><b>TRACE:</b> The TRACE method performs a message loop-back test along the path to the target resource.</li>
			<li><b>PATCH:</b> The PATCH method is used to apply partial modifications to a resource.</li>
