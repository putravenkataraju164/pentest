      <google-codelab-step label="Advanced Malware" duration="3">
        <h2 is-upgraded>Polymorphic Malware</h2>
		<p>Malware that constantly changes its identifiable features in order to evade detection. Polymorphic techniques involve frequently changing identifiable characteristics like file names and types or encryption keys to make the malware unrecognizable to many detection techniques.</p>
     	<p>Polymorphism is used to evade pattern-matching detection relied on by security solutions like antivirus software. While certain characteristics of polymorphic malware change, its functional purpose remains the same.</p>
        <aside class="special"><p><strong>Example:</strong> A polymorphic virus will continue to spread and infect devices even if its signature changes to avoid detection. By changing characteristics to generate a new signature, signature-based detection solutions will not recognize the file as malicious. Even if the new signature is identified and added to antivirus solutions’ signature database, polymorphic malware can continue to change signatures and carry out attacks without being detected.</p>

	 <aside class="special"><p><strong>Ping Flood Attack</strong> A ping flood is a denial-of-service attack in which the attacker attempts to overwhelm a targeted device with ICMP echo-request packets, causing the target to become inaccessible to normal traffic. When the attack traffic comes from multiple devices, the attack becomes a DDoS or distributed denial-of-service attack.</p>
	 <p class="image-container"><img style="width: 400.00px" "height: 400.00px" src="../chap1/ping-icmp.png"></p>
	 </aside>
	 <aside class="special"><p><strong>Smurf Attack</strong> The Smurf attack is a distributed denial-of-service attack in which large numbers of Internet Control Message Protocol (ICMP) packets with the intended victim's spoofed source IP are broadcast to a computer network using an IP broadcast address</p>
	 <p class="image-container"><img style="width: 400.00px" "height: 450.00px" src="../chap1/smurf-attack.png"></p>

	<h2 is-upgraded>DNS</h2>
	<p>The Domain Name System (DNS) is a hierarchical and decentralized naming system for computers, services, or other resources connected to the Internet or a private network. It associates various information with domain names assigned to each of the participating entities. Most prominently, it translates more readily memorized domain names to the numerical IP addresses</p>

	<google-codelab-step label="Network Attacks" duration="15">
	<h2 is-upgraded>DNS Poisoning</h2>
	<p>DNS cache poisoning, also known as DNS spoofing, is a type of attack that exploits vulnerabilities in the domain name system (DNS) to divert Internet traffic away from legitimate servers and towards fake ones.</p>
	<p class="image-container"><img style="width: 400.00px" "height: 450.00px" src="../chap1/dns-poisoning.jpg"></p>
	<h2 is-upgraded>ARP Poisoning</h2>
	<p>A technique by which an attacker sends (spoofed) Address Resolution Protocol (ARP) messages onto a local area network. Generally, the aim is to associate the attacker's MAC address with the IP address of another host, such as the default gateway, causing any traffic meant for that IP address to be sent to the attacker instead.</p>
	<p class="image-container"><img style="width: 400.00px" "height: 450.00px" src="../chap1/arp-poisoning.png"></p>
	<h2 is-upgraded>MAC Address spoofing</h2>
	<p>MAC spoofing is a technique for changing a factory-assigned Media Access Control (MAC) address of a network interface on a networked device.</p>
	<p><strong>Example:</strong>
	<pre><code>root@kali:~# macchanger -r eth0
	Current MAC:   08:00:27:5b:88:c8 (CADMUS COMPUTER SYSTEMS)
	Permanent MAC: 08:00:27:5b:88:c8 (CADMUS COMPUTER SYSTEMS)
	New MAC:       9a:f9:93:43:e4:29 (unknown)
	</p></pre></code>
	<h2 is-upgraded>IP Address spoofing</h2>
	<p>IP address spoofing or IP spoofing is the creation of Internet Protocol (IP) packets with a false source IP address, for the purpose of impersonating another computing system.</p>
