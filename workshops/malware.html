			<h2 is-upgraded>Malware Analysis</h2>
      <p>Malware analysis is the art of dissecting malware to understand how its works, how to identify it, and how to defeat or eliminate it. And you don’t need to be an uber-hacker to perform malware analysis.</p>
      <h2 is-upgraded>Prerequisites</h2>
			<ul>
			<li>Information Security Basics</li>
			<li>Basic Knowledge in Security</li>
			<li>Familiar with Windows and Linux OS</li>
			<li>Programming knowledge in Assembly language and C language</li>
			</ul>
			<h2 is-upgraded>What you&#39;ll learn</h2>
			<ul class="checklist">
			<li>Different Malware Analysis Techniques</li>
			<li>How to use Anti-disassembly and Anti-debugging or packing techniques</li>
			<li>Practical Malware Analysis and Reverse Engineering</li>
			<li>Working with various MA and RE Tools</li>
			</ul>
      </google-codelab-step>
      <google-codelab-step label="Malware Analysis Premier" duration="30">
			<ul>
      <li>The purpose  of <code>malware analysis</code> is usually to provide the information you need to respond to a network intrusion.</li>
      <li>Your goals will typically be to determine exactly what happened, and to ensure that you’ve located all infected machines and files.</li>
      <li>When analyzing suspected malware, your goal will typically be to determine exactly what a particular suspect binary can do, how to detect it on your network, and how to measure and contain its damage.</li>
      <li>Once you identify which files require full analysis, it’s time to develop signatures to detect malware infections on your network</li>
      </ul>
      <h2 is-upgraded>Signatures / Indicators</h2>
      <p>Malware analysis can be used to develop <code>host-based</code> and <code>network signatures</code>.</p>
      <ul>
      <li><b>Host-based signatures</b> are used to detect malicious code on victim computers. These indicators often identify files created or modified by the malware or specific changes that it makes to the registry.</li>
      <aside class="special">Unlike antivirus signatures, malware indicators focus on what the malware does to a system, not on the characteristics of the malware itself, which makes them more effective in detecting malware that changes form or that has been deleted from the hard disk.</aside>
      <li><b>Network signatures</b> are used to detect malicious code by monitoring network traffic. Network signatures can be created without malware analysis, but signatures created with the help of malware analysis are usually far more effective, offering a higher detection rate and fewer false positives</li>
      </ul>
      <h2 is-upgraded>Malware Analysis Techniques</h2>
      <p>There are two fundamental approaches to malware analysis: <code>static</code> and <code>dynamic</code>. Both static and dynamic are further categorized as <code>basic</code> or <code>advanced</code>.</p>
      <ol>
        <pre><code>Static analysis involves examining the malware without running it.<br>Dynamic analysis involves running the malware.</code></pre>
        <li><b>Basic static analysis</b> consists of examining the executable file without viewing the actual instructions. Basic static analysis can confirm whether a file is malicious, provide information about its functionality, and sometimes provide information that will allow you to produce simple network signatures. </li>
        <li><b>Basic dynamic analysis</b> techniques involve running the malware and observing its behavior on the system in order to remove the infection, produce effective signatures, or both.</li>
          <aside class="special">Basic dynamic analysis techniques can be used by most people without deep programming knowledge, but they won’t be effective with all malware and can miss important functionality.</aside>
        <li><b>Advanced static analysis</b> consists of reverse-engineering the malware’s internals by loading the executable into a disassembler and looking at the program instructions in order to discover what the program does. The instructions are executed by the CPU.</li>
        <li><b>Advanced dynamic analysis</b> uses a debugger to examine the internal state of a running malicious executable. It provide another way to extract detailed information from an executable.</li>
          <aside class="special">Advance techniques are most useful when you’re trying to obtain information that is difficult to gather with the other techniques.</aside>
      </ol>
      <pre><code>Before you can run malware safely, you must set up an environment that will allow you to study the running malware without risk of damage to your system or network.</code></pre>

     <google-codelab-step label="Portable Executable (PE)" duration="15">
      <p>Portable Executable (PE) file format is used by Windows executables, object code, and DLLs. The PE file format is a data structure that contains the information necessary for the Windows OS loader to manage the wrapped executable code.</p>
      <ul>
        <li> Nearly every file with executable code that is loaded by Windows is in the PE file format, though some legacy file formats do appear on rare occasion in malware. </li>
        <li>PE files begin with a header that includes information about the code, the type of application, required library functions, and space requirements. The information in the PE header is of great value to the malware analyst.</li>
      </ul>
      <h2 is-upgraded>PE File Headers and Sections</h2>
      <p>The PE file format contains a header followed by a series of sections. The header contains metadata about the file itself. Following the header are the actual sections of the file, each of which contains useful information.</p>

      <h2 is-upgraded>Functions</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>Imports are functions used by one program that are actually stored in a different program, such as code libraries that contain functionality common to many programs. Code libraries can be connected to the main executable by <code>linking</code>.</li>
        <aside class="special">Programmers link imports to their programs so that they don’t need to re-implement certain functionality in multiple programs. Code libraries can be linked statically, at runtime, or dynamically</aside>
        <li>Exports are functions in the malware that are meant to be called by other programs or libraries</li>
      </ul>
      <h2 is-upgraded>Linked Libraries</h2>
      <ul>
        <li><b>Static linking</b> is the least commonly used method of linking libraries (it is common in UNIX and Linux programs). When a library is statically linked to an executable, all code from that library is copied into the executable, which makes the executable grow in size.</li>
        <li><b>Runtime linking</b> is commonly used in malware, especially when it’s <code>packed</code> or <code>obfuscated</code>. Executables that use runtime linking connect to libraries only when that function is needed.</li>
        <li><b>Dynamic linking</b> in which all the libraries are linked at program start.</li>
      </ul>
      <h2 is-upgraded>Obfuscated and Packed Malware</h2>
      <p>Malware writers often use packing or obfuscation to make their files more difficult to detect or analyze.</p>
      <ul>
        <li><b>Obfuscated</b> programs are ones whose execution the malware author has attempted to hide, not understandable.</li>
        <li><b>Packing</b> programs are a subset ofobfuscated programs in which the malicious program is compressed and cannot be analyzed </li>
        <aside class="special">Both techniques will severely limit your attempts to statically analyze the malware.</aside>
