			<h2 is-upgraded>Malware Analysis</h2>
      <ul>
      <li>Malware analysis is the art of dissecting malware to understand how its works, how to identify it, and how to defeat or eliminate it. And you don’t need to be an uber-hacker to perform malware analysis.</li>
      </ul>
      <h2 is-upgraded>Prerequisites</h2>
			<ul>
			<li>Information Security Basics</li>
			<li>Basic Knowledge in Security</li>
			<li>Familiar with Windows and Linux OS</li>
			<li>Programming knowledge in Assembly language and C language</li>
			</ul>
			<h2 is-upgraded>What you&#39;ll learn</h2>
			<ul>
			<li>Different Malware Analysis Techniques</li>
			<li>How to use Anti-disassembly and Anti-debugging or packing techniques</li>
			<li>Practical Malware Analysis and Reverse Engineering</li>
			<li>Working with various MA and RE Tools</li>
			</ul>

			<ul>
      <li>The purpose  of <code>malware analysis</code> is usually to provide the information you need to respond to a network intrusion.</li>
      <li>Your goals will typically be to determine exactly what happened, and to ensure that you’ve located all infected machines and files.</li>
      <li>When analyzing suspected malware, your goal will typically be to determine exactly what a particular suspect binary can do, how to detect it on your network, and how to measure and contain its damage.</li>
      <li>Once you identify which files require full analysis, it’s time to develop signatures to detect malware infections on your network</li>
      </ul>
      <h2 is-upgraded>Signatures / Indicators</h2>
      <ul>Malware analysis can be used to develop <code>host-based</code> and <code>network signatures</code>.
      <li><b>Host-based signatures</b> are used to detect malicious code on victim computers. These indicators often identify files created or modified by the malware or specific changes that it makes to the registry.</li>
      <aside class="special">Unlike antivirus signatures, malware indicators focus on what the malware does to a system, not on the characteristics of the malware itself, which makes them more effective in detecting malware that changes form or that has been deleted from the hard disk.</aside>
      <li><b>Network signatures</b> are used to detect malicious code by monitoring network traffic. Network signatures can be created without malware analysis, but signatures created with the help of malware analysis are usually far more effective, offering a higher detection rate and fewer false positives</li>
      </ul>
      <h2 is-upgraded>Malware Analysis Techniques</h2>
      <ul>There are two fundamental approaches to malware analysis: <code>static</code> and <code>dynamic</code>. Both static and dynamic are further categorized as <code>basic</code> or <code>advanced</code>.
        <pre><code>Static analysis involves examining the malware without running it.<br>Dynamic analysis involves running the malware.</code></pre>
        <li><b>Basic static analysis</b> consists of examining the executable file without viewing the actual instructions. Basic static analysis can confirm whether a file is malicious, provide information about its functionality, and sometimes provide information that will allow you to produce simple network signatures. </li>
        <li><b>Basic dynamic analysis</b> techniques involve running the malware and observing its behavior on the system in order to remove the infection, produce effective signatures, or both.</li>
          <aside class="special">Basic dynamic analysis techniques can be used by most people without deep programming knowledge, but they won’t be effective with all malware and can miss important functionality.</aside>
        <li><b>Advanced static analysis</b> consists of reverse-engineering the malware’s internals by loading the executable into a disassembler and looking at the program instructions in order to discover what the program does. The instructions are executed by the CPU.</li>
        <li><b>Advanced dynamic analysis</b> uses a debugger to examine the internal state of a running malicious executable. It provide another way to extract detailed information from an executable.</li>
          <aside class="special">Advance techniques are most useful when you’re trying to obtain information that is difficult to gather with the other techniques.</aside>
      </ul>
      <pre><code>Before you can run malware safely, you must set up an environment that will allow you to study the running malware without risk of damage to your system or network.</code></pre>

  <google-codelab-step label="Types of Malware" duration="15">
    <li><b>Backdoor:</b> Malicious code that installs itself onto a computer to allow the attacker access. Backdoors usually let the attacker connect to the computer with little or no authentication and execute commands on the local system.</li>
    <li><b>Botnet:</b> Similar to a backdoor, in that it allows the attacker access to the system, but all computers infected with the same botnet receive the same instructions from a single command-and-control server.</li>
    <li><b>Downloader:</b> Malicious code that exists only to download other malicious code. Downloaders are commonly installed by attackers when they first gain access to a system. The downloader program will download and install additional malicious code.</li>
    <li><b>Information-stealing malware:</b> Malware that collects information from a victim’s computer and usually sends it to the attacker. Examples include sniffers, password hash grabbers, and keyloggers. This malware is typically used to gain access to online accounts such as email or online banking.</li>
    <li><b>Launcher:</b> Malicious program used to launch other malicious programs. Usually, launchers use nontraditional techniques to launch other malicious programs in order to ensure stealth or greater access to a system.</li>
    <li><b>Rootkit:</b> Malicious code designed to conceal the existence of other code. Rootkits are usually paired with other malware, such as a backdoor, to allow remote access to the attacker and make the code difficult for the victim to detect.</li>
    <li><b>Scareware:</b> Malware designed to frighten an infected user into buying something. It usually has a user interface that makes it look like an antivirus or other security program. It informs users that there is malicious code on their system and that the only way to get rid of it is to buy their “software,” when in reality, the software it’s selling does nothing more than remove the scareware.</li>
    <li><b>Spam-sending malware:</b> Malware that infects a user’s machine and then uses that machine to send spam. This malware generates income for attackers by allowing them to sell spam-sending services.</li>
    <li><b>Worm or virus:</b> Malicious code that can copy itself and infect additional computers.</li>
